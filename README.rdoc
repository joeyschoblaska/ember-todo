== EmberTODO

Fumbling my way through a Rails/Ember hybrid TODO list app to help me learn Ember. I'm going to attempt to embed Ember where-needed in my Rails views instead of doing a standard one-page Ember app, as this more closely resembles how I'll be using Ember in a different app I'm working on (whether or not it's actually a good pattern).
